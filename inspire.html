        		What makes a hero? A hero is someone that inspires you to be your best self. Heroes are people that you want to be like when you grow up. <y favorite part is the glimpses of ability that almost seem unhuman because of how impressive it is.
    		</p>
    		<p>
        		The hero that I most admire have the following characteristics.
    		</p>
    		<ul>
        		<li>Clutch - They make it count when it matters most</li>
        		<li>Inspiring - Making a difference in peoples lives</li>
        		<li>Innovating - Being the first of something in your generation</li>
        		<li>Leader - Coaches and motivates golfers in the PGA and around the world</li>
        		<li>Winner - They show what it looks like to be truly dominate</li> 
            <li>Brave - Do things that others are afraid to do</li>
    		</ul>
    		<p>
        		Over the last 26 years no man has quite had the legacy that Tiger has had in golf. He has stayed true to himself and the pga tour through thick amd thin. Although there has been contraversy in the past few years he has upheld himself and reputatuion in my eyes. From my generation to many to come Tiger will continue to inspire young men and women to play the game of golf.
