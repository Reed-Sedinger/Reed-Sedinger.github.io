    <h2>Go to Amusement</h2>
    <p>I personally love sports and laughing. When I need a pick me up I always go to this website because there are some of my personal favorites in here.  I personally enjoy number 10 on this website, not only because its funny but also fufils my dislike for the Dallas Cowboys.</p>

    <h2>Pepe</h2>
    <p>An internet sensation that always brings a smile to my face is pepe.  I first remeber seeing these memes in early highschool. These have evolved into more complex memes and videos today.  Although his lore has been twisted in the media recently, I still will ejoy it because I don't look at these memes for all of the bad things they may entail.  It just brings a good laugh.</p>
